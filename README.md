# Study on The Effectiveness of Government Regulation of Dine Safety

## Overview

This repo determines whether government regulation is effective by analyzing the consistency between the geographic location of stores and the geographic location of government inspections.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

I use Chatgpt to teach myself how to make a table, and also use Chatgpt to teach myself how to delete files on Github.
